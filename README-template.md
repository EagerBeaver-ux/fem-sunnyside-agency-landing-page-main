## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Dynamic dimensions
- Media queries 


### What I learned

Following are the aspects that I tried using in this design and it makes the process easier and more responsive:

1. Flex & Grid layouts
2. Use of Viewport width and height, correct understanding of em and rem.
3. No use of static dimensions
4. Use of dimensions, font & colour related information from Sketch files. ( I need to improve upon this and perfect the dimensions aspect)
5. Media Queries for making the design more responsive.
 
### Continued development

1. Much higher attention to detail - There are differences in the layout between the provided design and the output. I will be coming back to this solution to get the design to be absolutely perfect and exactly the same as the design.

2. The code needs to be more DRY - Will be revisiting the code to make it leaner and remove repetitions

3. Adjustments in the layout - in margins, padding etc. - it seem to undergo multiple iterations. A change at one part of the page affected a different aspect of the layout of the page. While I do understand that a part of it is trial and error. However, will spend more time "before starting to code a project" to plan the layout and understand it, to see if that helps reducing the iterations required to arrive at the right layout. 

The permutations there could also be something that I would want to experiment with in my next project. (a) the use of "border-box", instead of "content-box". (b) using Art Direction in my HTML instead of long bodies for Media Queries in my CSS (c) Spending some time to plan out the layout before hand - decide upon the display options required for different sections of the page, estimate the margins and areas, etc understand how the layout of these sections will switch between device widths. (d) Include more JS in the code - much more.
